# Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Adds two operands | `A + B = 30` |
| `-` | Subtracts second operand from the first | `A - B = 10` |
| `*` | Multiplies both operands | `A * B = 200` |
| `/` | Divides numberator by de-numerator | `B / A = 2` |
| `%` | Modulus Operator and the remainder of after an integer division | `B % A = 0` |
| `++` | Increment operator increases the integer value by one | `A++ = 11` |
| `--` | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one | `A-- = 9` |

### Relational Operators


| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | `(A == B)` is not true |
| `!=` | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition beccomes true. | `(A != B)` is true |
| `>` | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | `(A > B)` is not true |
| `<` | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | `(A < B)` is true |
| `>=` | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | `(A >= B)` is not true |
| `<=` | Checks if the value of the the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | `(A <= B)` is true |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&&` | Called logical **and** operator. If bothe the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | `(A && B)` is false |
| `||` | Called logical **or** operator. If any of the two ooperands in non-zero, then the condition becomes true. | `(A || B)` is true |
| `!` | Called logical **not** operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the logical NOT operator will make it false. | `!(A && B)` is true |

### Bitwise Operators


| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&` | Binary **and** operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. | `(A & B) = 12` i.e. `00001100` |
| `|` | Binary **or** operator copies a bit if it esists in either operand. | `(A | B) = 61` i.e. `00111101` |
| `^` | Binary **xor** operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. | `(A ^ B) = 49` i.e. `00110001` |
| `~` | Binary ones **complement** operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits. | `(~A) = -61` i.e. `11000011` in 2's complement form |
| `<<` | Binary **left shift** operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | `A << 2 = 240` i.e. `11110000` |
| `>>` | Binary **right shift** operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | `A >> 2 = 15` i.e. `00001111` |

### Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand | `C = A + B` will assign the value of `A + B` to `C` |
| `+=` | Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. | `C += A` is equivalent to `C = C + A` |
| `-=` | Subtract and assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. | `C -= A` is equivalent to `C = C - A` |
| `*=` | Multiply and assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. | `C *= A` is equivalent to `C = C * A` |
| `/=` | Divide and assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand. | `C /= A` is equivalent to `C = C / A` |
| `%=` | Modulus and assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand. | `C %= A` is equivalent to `C = C % A` |
| `<<=` | Left shift and assignment operator. | `C <<= 2` is the same as `C << 2` |
| `>>=` | Right shift and assignment operator. | `C >>= 2` is same as `C = C >> 2` |
| `&=` | Bitwise and assignment operator. | `C &= 2` is same as `C = C & 2` |
| `^=` | Bitwise exclusive or and assignment operator. | `C ^= 2` is same as `C = C ^ 2` |
| `|=` | Bitwise inclusive or and assignment operator. | `C |= 2` is same as `C = C | 2` |

### Misc Operators â†¦ sizeof & ternary

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `sizeof()` | Returns the size of a variable | `sizeof(a)` where `a` is integer, will return `4` |
| `&` | Returns the address of a variable | `&a;` returns the actual address of the variable |
| `*` | Pointer to a variable | `*a;` |
| `? :` | Conditional expression | If condition is true `?` then value `x` `:` otherwise value `y` |
