# Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| + | Adds two operands | A + B = 30 |
| - | Subtracts second operand from the first | A - B = 10 |
| * | Multiplies both operands | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numberator by de-numerator | B / A = 2 |
| % | Modulus Operator and the remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0 |
| ++ | Increment operator increases the integer value by one | A++ = 11 |
| -- | Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one | A-- = 9 |

### Relational Operators


| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true |
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition beccomes true. | (A != B) is true |
| > | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A > B) is not true |
| < | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A < B) is true |
| >= | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A >= B) is not true |
| <= | Checks if the value of the the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true. | (A <= B) is true |
