# Backslashes

### Why are there back slashes \ in front of the quote marks " in the grammar?

Because if the backslashes weren't there the `"` would escape. Thus making it a collection of a few strings instead of one long string.

### Why are there back slashes \ at the end of the line in the grammar?

This is to make it more readable instead of having one line that is 200 characters long.
