# Decimal Number Grammer

The number of decimal places that are non-zero determine which unit you will use to say the number. For example `0.087` and  `0.087000` would both be *eighty seven thousandths*. 

`0.1` = One tenth
`0.01` = One hundredth
`0.001` = One thousandth
`0.0001` = One ten thousandth

`0.8` = Eight tenths
`0.04` = Four hundredths
`0.009` = Nine thousandths
`0.003` = Three ten thousandths
