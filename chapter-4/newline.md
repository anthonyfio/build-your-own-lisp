# Newline Character

The newline character in C is `\n`. It means that the contents after the `\n` will be on a newline.

### Sample usage

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```

### Sample output

```
% ./program
Hello World
% there will be a blinking cursor here
```
